# CodeClauseInternship_Predicting-House-Prices

This project is about building linear regression model to predict house prices based on bed and lot size.
First we imported and loaded the data using pandas library and plotted the predicted v/s actual price data using matplotlib.pyplot library
Checked whether there is any column containing null values or not using isnull() method and cleaned the data using dropna() method 
Set the "lot_size" and "beds" as features and "price" as target variable and eventually splitting data into test and train sets
Building and training the model using LinerRegression from sklearn and eventually plotting the model using matplotlib.pyplot
